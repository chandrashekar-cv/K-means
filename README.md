# K-means
K-means algorithm.

K-means clustering of data points. In this implementation I have considered the data points te be vector co-ordinates of points in multidimensional space. Code is scalable to any dimension. Constraint is that all the data points need to be of the same dimension. Euclidean distance is used to identify the cluster for a data point. Code is modular and easy to understand. The distance metrics calculation is written in a different function so that the code can be reused on different data sets or different distance metrics by just replacing the distance calculation function.   If you feel the code needs some updates or optimization, then please let me know. We can work together to make it even simpler.
